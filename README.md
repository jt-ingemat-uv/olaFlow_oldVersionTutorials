OLAFLOW - Older version tutorials
======
# Description
olaFlow (https://github.com/phicau/olaFlow) is a free and open source project committed to bringing the latest advances in the simulation of wave dynamics to the OpenFOAM® and FOAM-extend communities. From version 1.6 and up to the present day olaFlow has been compatible with all OpenFOAM and FOAM-extend versions. This means that because the ecosystem has changed so much in all these years, the structure of the cases has evolved too.

This repository includes the historic record of tutorials released along with olaFlow for the major past versions. Although we recommend always using the latest version of OpenFOAM or FOAM-extend, which includes the latest bug fixes, we host this tutorials in case anyone is till using older versions.

The tutorials for the current version of OpenFOAM remain in the original olaFlow repository (https://github.com/phicau/olaFlow).
